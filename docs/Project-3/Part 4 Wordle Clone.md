# Part 4 My Wordle

For this problem, youâ€™ll implement a program that behaves similarly to the popular Wordle daily word game.

<pre>
$ python wordle.py 5
This is <span style="color:green">MyWordle</span>
You have 6 tries to guess the 5-letter word I'm thinking of
Input a 5-letter word: crash
Guess 1: <span style="color:yellow">c</span><span style="color:red">ra</span><span style="color:yellow">s</span><span style="color:red">h</span>
Input a 5-letter word: scone
Guess 2: scone
Input a 5-letter word: since
Guess 3: <span style="color:green">since</span>
You won!</pre>

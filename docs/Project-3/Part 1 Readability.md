# Part 1: Readability

According to [Scholastic](https://www.scholastic.com/teachers/teaching-tools/collections/guided-reading-book-lists-for-every-level.html), E.B. White's *Charlotte's Web* is between a second- and fourth-grade reading level, and Lois Lowry's *The Giver* is between an eighth- and twelfth-grade reading level. What does it mean, though, for a book to be at a particular reading level?

Well, in many cases, a human expert might read a book and make a decision on the grade (i.e., year in school) for which they think the book is most appropriate. But an algorithm could likely figure that out too!

So what sorts of traits are characteristic of higher reading levels? Well, longer words probably correlate with higher reading levels. Likewise, longer sentences probably correlate with higher reading levels, too.

A number of "readability tests" have been developed over the years that define formulas for computing the reading level of a text. One such readability test is the Coleman-Liau index. The Coleman-Liau index of a text is designed to output that (U.S.) grade level that is needed to understand some text. The formula is

``` text
index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8
```

where `L` is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text, and `S` is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text.

Letâ€™s write a program called `readability` that takes a text and determines its reading level. For example, if user types in a line of text from Dr. Seuss, the program should behave as follows:

``` text
$ python readability.py
Text: Congratulations! Today is your day. You're off to Great Places! You're off and away!
Grade 3
```

The text the user inputted has 65 letters, 4 sentences, and 14 words. 65 letters per 14 words is an average of about 464.29 letters per 100 words (because 65 / 14 * 100 = 464.29). And 4 sentences per 14 words is an average of about 28.57 sentences per 100 words (because 4 / 14 * 100 = 28.57). Plugged into the Coleman-Liau formula, and rounded to the nearest integer, we get an answer of 3 (because 0.0588 * 464.29 - 0.296 * 28.57 - 15.8 = 3): so this passage is at a third-grade reading level.

Let's try another one:

``` text
$ python readability.py
Text: Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his homework, but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of the night. And he also happened to be a wizard.
Grade 5
```

This text has 214 letters, 4 sentences, and 56 words. That comes out to about 382.14 letters per 100 words, and 7.14 sentences per 100 words. Plugged into the Coleman-Liau formula, we get a fifth-grade reading level.

As the average number of letters and words per sentence increases, the Coleman-Liau index gives the text a higher reading level. If you were to take this paragraph, for instance, which has longer words and sentences than either of the prior two examples, the formula would give the text an twelfth-grade reading level.

``` text
$ python readability.py
Text: As the average number of letters and words per sentence increases, the Coleman-Liau index gives the text a higher reading level. If you were to take this paragraph, for instance, which has longer words and sentences than either of the prior two examples, the formula would give the text an twelfth-grade reading level.
Grade 12
```

## Specification

Design and implement a program, `readability`, that computes the Coleman-Liau index of text.

- Implement your program in a file called `readability.py`.
- Your program should count the number of letters, words, and sentences in the text. You may assume that a letter is any lowercase character from `a` to `z` or any uppercase character from `A` to `Z`, any sequence of characters separated by spaces should count as a word, and that any occurrence of a period, exclamation point, or question mark indicates the end of a sentence.
- Your program should print as output `Grade X` where `X` is the grade level computed by the Coleman-Liau formula, rounded to the nearest integer.
- If the resulting index number is 16 or higher (equivalent to or greater than a senior undergraduate reading level), your program should output `Grade 16+` instead of giving the exact index number. If the index number is less than 1, your program should output `Before Grade 1`.

## Steps

Implement in `readability.py` a main function called `readability(text: str) -> str` that takes a string input and return a string.  This has been done for you.

### Letters

Let's begin to analyze that input by first counting the number of letters in the text. Consider letters to be uppercase or lowercase alphabetical character, not punctuation, digits, or other symbols.

Add to `readability.py` a function called `count_letters(text: str) -> int` that takes one argument, a string of text, and that returns an int, the number of letters in that text.

The function should now behave per the below.

``` python
>>> text = 'Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, "and what is the use of a book," thought Alice "without pictures or conversation?' 
>>> count_letters(text)
235
```

### Words

The Coleman-Liau index cares not only about the number of letters but also about the number of words in a sentence. For the purpose of this problem, we'll consider any sequence of characters separated by a space to be a word (so a hyphenated word like "sister-in-law" should be considered one word, not three).

Add to `readability.py` a function called `count_words(text: str) -> int` that takes one argument, a `string` of text, and that returns an `int`, the number of words in that text.

Then call that function in `readability` so that your program also prints the number of words in the text.

Assume that a sentence will not start or end with a space, and assume that a sentence will not have multiple spaces in a row, notwithstanding the walkthrough video, which was recorded before this specification was modified.

The function should behave per the below.

``` python
>>> text = "It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him."
>>> count_letters(text)
250
>>> count_words(text)
55
```

### Sentances

The last piece of information that the Coleman-Liau formula cares about, in addition to the number of letters and words, is the number of sentences. Determining the number of sentences can be surprisingly tricky. You might first imagine that a sentence is just any sequence of characters that ends with a period, but of course sentences could end with an exclamation point or a question mark as well. But of course, not all periods necessarily mean the sentence is over. For instance, consider the sentence below.

``` text
Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much.
```

This is just a single sentence, but there are three periods! For this problem, we'll ask you to ignore that subtlety: you should consider any sequence of characters that ends with a . or a ! or a ? to be a sentence (so for the above "sentence", you should count it as three sentences). In practice, sentence boundary detection needs to be a little more intelligent to handle these cases, but we'll not worry about that for now.

Add to `readability.py` a function called `count_sentences(text: str) -> int` that takes one argument, a string of text, and that returns an int, the number of sentences in that text.

Then call that function in `readability` so that your program also prints the number of sentences in the text.

The program should now behave per the below.

``` python
>>> text = "When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow. When it healed, and Jem's fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was somewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand was at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh."
>>> count_letters(text)
295
>>> count_words(text)
70
>>> count_sentences(text)
3
```

### Putting it All Together

Now it's time to put all the pieces together! Recall that the Coleman-Liau index is computed using the formula:

``` text
index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8
```

where `L` is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text, and `S` is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text.

Modify `readability` in `readability.py` so that instead of outputting the number of letters, words, and sentences, it instead outputs (only) the grade level as defined by the Coleman-Liau index (e.g. "Grade 2" or "Grade 8" or the like). Be sure to round the resulting index number to the nearest int!

If the resulting index number is 16 or higher (equivalent to or greater than a senior undergraduate reading level), your program should output "Grade 16+" instead of outputting an exact index number. If the index number is less than 1, your program should output "Before Grade 1".

The function should now behaves per the below.

``` python
>>> text = "One fish. Two fish. Red fish. Blue fish." 
>>> readability(text)
'Before Grade 1'
>>> text = "Would you like them here or there? I would not like them here or there. I would not like them anywhere."
>>> readability(text)
'Grade 2'
>>> text = "A large class of computational problems involve the determination of properties of graphs, digraphs, integers, arrays of integers, finite families of finite sets, boolean formulas and elements of other countable domains."
>>> readability(text)
'Grade 16+'
```

### Walkthrough

The project mirrors the project done in Harvard's CS 50 course, but is ported to Python. You might find their walkthrough helpful, although it does reference some ideas specific to the C programming language.

## How to Test Your Code

Try running your program on the following texts, to ensure you see the specified grade level. Be sure to copy only the text, no extra spaces.

- `One fish. Two fish. Red fish. Blue fish.` (Before Grade 1)
- `Would you like them here or there? I would not like them here or there. I would not like them anywhere.` (Grade 2)
- `Congratulations! Today is your day. You're off to Great Places! You're off and away!` (Grade 3)
- `Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his homework, but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of the night. And he also happened to be a wizard.` (Grade 5)
- `In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.` (Grade 7)
- `Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, "and what is the use of a book," thought Alice "without pictures or conversation?"` (Grade 8)
- `When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow. When it healed, and Jem's fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was somewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand was at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh.` (Grade 8)
- `There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.` (Grade 9)
- `It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him.` (Grade 10)
- `A large class of computational problems involve the determination of properties of graphs, digraphs, integers, arrays of integers, finite families of finite sets, boolean formulas and elements of other countable domains.` (Grade 16+)

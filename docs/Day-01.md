# Day 01


## What is a "computer"?

- The machine in front of you is a *modern* computer.
- A computer is one who computes.
- You are a computer!
- By today’s standards you are a slow computer with bad memory… but necessary to design and implement modern computers.
- We need tools to aid in our computation as we move into the future

## What does a computer do?

- Performs calculations
- Remembers calculations
- What a human tells it to do

> “What I mean is that if you really want to understand something, the best way is to try and explain it ~~to~~ someone else. That forces you to sort it out in your own mind... And that’s really the essence of programming. By the time you’ve sorted out a complicated idea into little steps that even a stupid machine can deal with, you’ve certainly learned something about it yourself.”

> ― Douglas Adams, Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency

## Terminology

**Computation** is any type of calculation that includes both arithmetical and non-arithmetical steps and which follows a well-defined model (e.g. an **algorithm**).

A **program** is a sequence of instructions that specify how to perform a computation.

## guessing game

``` text
I am thinking of a number! Try to guess the number I'm thinking of: 10
Too low! Guess again: 100
Too high! Guess again: -100
Too low! Guess again: 95
That's it! Would you like to play again? (yes/no) 
```

Main Ideas

- *variables* to store numbers
- *conditionals* or *branching* to test guess
- input/output
- repetition (looping)
- numbers (ints, floats, etc)
- words (strings)
- actions (functions)
- implementing further features such as randomness

We will eventually build this, take care of errors, and improve gameplay.

## REPL

A **Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)**, also known as an interactive shell, is a simple, interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs (READ) (i.e. single expressions), EVALUATES them, and returns (PRINTS) the result to the user; a program written in a REPL environment is executed piecewise.

## Arithmetic Operators

[Official Python Docs: 3.8 Using Python as a Calculator](https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/introduction.html#using-python-as-a-calculator)

Arithmetic operators follow standard order of operation

- `()` : parentheses
- `**` : exponentiation
- `+` : addition
- `-` : subtraction
- `*` : multiplication
- `/` : division

## calculator (interactive)

``` python
>>> 3 + 3
6
>>> (3 + 6) ** 2
36
>>> 5 / 2
2.5
>>> 100 / 50 - 1
1.0
```

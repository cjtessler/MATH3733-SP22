## 19 Turtle Drawing

### Instructions

Write a void function (a function that returns `None`) to draw a square. Use it in a program to draw the image shown below. Assume each side is 20 units. 

Hint: Notice that the turtle has already moved away from the ending point of the last square when the program ends.

You might find it useful to review the lesson at [Learn Python the Right Way, Chapter 4](https://learnpythontherightway.com/chapter/chapter-4.html) and the [Official Turtle Documentation](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/turtle.html) in order to see examples of other methods necessary to recreate the drawing.

## 21 Recursive Turtle

### Instructions

A Sierpinski triangle of order 0 is an equilateral triangle. An order 1 triangle can be drawn by drawing 3 smaller triangles (shown slightly disconnected here, just to help our understanding). Higher order 2 and 3 triangles are also shown. Use a recurive function to draw Sierpinski triangles of order `n`, where `n` is a parameter of the recursive function.

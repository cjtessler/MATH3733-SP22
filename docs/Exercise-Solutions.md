## 19 Turtle Drawing

### Instructions

Write a void function (a function that returns `None`) to draw a square. Use it in a program to draw the image shown below. Assume each side is 20 units. 

Hint: Notice that the turtle has already moved away from the ending point of the last square when the program ends.

You might find it useful to review the lesson at [Learn Python the Right Way, Chapter 4](https://learnpythontherightway.com/chapter/chapter-4.html) and the [Official Turtle Documentation](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/turtle.html) in order to see examples of other methods necessary to recreate the drawing.

## 20 Recursion

``` python
def f(n, a, b):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return a + f(n-1, a + b, b)
```

## 21 Recursive Turtle

### Instructions

A Sierpinski triangle of order 0 is an equilateral triangle. An order 1 triangle can be drawn by drawing 3 smaller triangles (shown slightly disconnected here, just to help our understanding). Higher order 2 and 3 triangles are also shown. Draw Sierpinski triangles of any order input by the user.

### Solution

``` python
import turtle

def recursive_triangles(t, n, length):  # Added length parameter
    if n == 0:  # Base case
        triangle(t, length)
    else: 
        # Draw first triangle USING RECURSIVE CALL at starting position (reduce n by one and length by half)

        # Move to midpoint of bottom side

        # Draw second triangle USING RECURSIVE CALL

        # Move back to starting location

        # Face alongside left side

        # Move to midpoint of left side

        # Face right to prepare for last triangle

        # Draw top triangle USING RECURSIVE CALL

        # Return to starting location


def triangle(t, size):
    for _ in range(3):
        t.forward(size)
        t.left(120.0)


t = turtle.Turtle()
recursive_triangles(t, 1, 300)
```

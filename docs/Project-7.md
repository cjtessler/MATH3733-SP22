# Project 7: Adventure

The final project is your opportunity to take your newfound savvy with programming out for a spin and develop your very own piece of software or learn an application of Python and present that. As long as your project draws upon the course’s lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you, albeit subject to approval.

It is highly recommend that you install Python locally at this point. Here is a great [tutorial](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) on how to do so. You don't necessarily want to be tied to Replit for all of your future projects. 

There are several options for writing code. My personal recommendation is [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) as it is designed specifcally for Python Development. PyCharm is an *integrated development environement (IDE)* so it has many of the same features we are used to from Replit. Here is a short video to get you up and running: [https://youtu.be/56bPIGf4us0](https://youtu.be/56bPIGf4us0). PyCharm is a fairly "heavy" program. That is, it can be slow of older machines.

Replit is capable of handling many different types of projects. So, feel free to experiment, but your mileage may vary. Google is your friend if you run into technical issues.

## Pre-project (Due Tuesday, April 19th)

Use the long weekend to research some possible projects. At this point, you have a solid foundation in Python so don't be afraid of loftier ideas. If you are unsure on what you want to do, try the following:

1. Think of a problem you would like to solve.
2. Research a topic that interests you.
3. Review the list of ideas provided below.
4. Come talk to me.

**Write a 250 word (minimum) plan for your project. Include a clear specification of what you plan to build, links to any tutorials you may use, the features you plan to implement, and what you envision for your presentation.* Feel free to use images, mockups, and/or whatever you deem appropriate to explain your goal. Your project will evolve as you write it, but it is important to have a clear goal before you begin coding. **Submit your plan on MyFire before Tuesday, April 19th, 11:59 PM.***

Think of a problem you want to solve or a project you want to build, use a tutorial to learn the basics of any new library you meed to use, and then independently build your idea. Building your own project is worth dozens of tutorials.

Here is a list of ideas and frameworks you can look into: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_D9k83syKltGZbj_Kr6p300SUxW5WD6vXOn_aig0k6g/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_D9k83syKltGZbj_Kr6p300SUxW5WD6vXOn_aig0k6g/edit?usp=sharing)

If your project is based on a tutorial, you must **significantly** extend the functionalities of the program in order to earn full points. Only the parts that you write will be considered towards the project grade. Turning is a project that is only tutorial will result in a poor grade (potentially zero).

Talk to me if you are having trouble coming up with an idea.

## Project Week (4/18 - 4/25)

Students will have class time during the last week of classes to work on Project 7. Here are the expcetations:

- The project is to be an independent endeavor. You are welcome to talk to your peers about your project, but each student is expected to complete a unique project.

- Cite *any* sources you use. This includes tutorials, Stack Overflow answers, GitHub repositories, and any other ideas or examples you see and implement into your project.

- Your project should demonstrate mastery of many, if not all, of the programming concepts covered in class: Variables, Functions, Conditionals, Iteration, Strings, Lists, Dictionaries, Classes, Reading Data, etc.

- Demonstrate mastery by explaining your project in a short recorded presentation.

- Put in the time necessary outside of class to complete a polished project.

## Submission

A **project plan** is due on Tuesday, April 19th, 11:59 PM.

The **project** is due on Tuesday, April 26th, 11:59 PM.
Submit the code for your project in a folder (zipped if necessary) titled `lastname-p7`.
Also include in the submission a text file titled `lastname-readme` containing any information the grader needs, references, and citations.
E.g., I would submit a folder `tessler-p7` with my project code and a file `tessler-readme`.

A **screencast** is due on Tuesday, April 26th, 11:59 PM.
Provide a screencast where you do the following:

- Describe your program
- Show the grader how to run your program
- Discuss your overall design and thought processes
- Highlight two to three parts of your code that you are proud of or found particularly challenging

The screencast is an opportunity for you to demonstrate mastery and show the effort and thought you put into the project.
Host the video on some platform and proivde the link on MyFire.

## Grading

The project will be graded based on the following rubric and possible deductions. Bonus *may* be awarded for an *exceptional* project.
